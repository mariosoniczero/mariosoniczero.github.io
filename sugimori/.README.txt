--- FAQ ---

[Q] What is .Sources?
[A] .Sources is a URL link to a spreadsheet that helps us keep track of where all of the Sugimori-style
    artwork in the archive is sourced from.

[Q] What are the .PSD files, and why do the colors look wrong?
[A] The .PSD files are original Photoshop files provided to Australian Press by Nintendo in 2004.
    Colors appear innaccurate in Google Drive as it incorrectly previews them with a CMYK color palette,
    but look totally fine when opened in Photoshop itself.

[Q] What is Carddass?
[A] Artwork drawn by Sugimori on Bandai Carddass cards released in 1996 and 1997, exclusively in Japan.
